        <p>When I was a kid I thought that the best job is a bank director or top manager (nowadays). I thought that bank director was a richest man as he is the most important person in the bank. And the bank of course is main money resource! Then I found out that there is a more important and rich person - the president! Powerful person which can have a lot of money money, more than a bank director! That was my childhood. I wanted all toys which my parents couldn't buy obviously because they need money therefore! </p>

        <p>When I was 14 years old as all teenagers I had stars idols. Singers, actors, whoever! How to meet them? I can be a journalist! Yeah! Why not? I can take interviews and this is how I can meet them in person! Great plan, ain't it?</p>

        <p>When I was 18 years old of course it is time to be sure which professional path will you choose! Ain't easy! I found out that journalist has to be open-minded, super talkative and with wrighting skills which I had at 0 level! I hated wrighting compositions and whatever related to text wrighting! So what was the plan? Let's get back to the bank business and money! Yay! I got back to the childhood. Obviously being president is slightly hard so I chose Business management with direction into accounting and tax! Yes, tax! We all know that no-one can avoid tax unless you are ready to have some issues with the government.  </p>

        <p>What is going on now? Before to go to university I had to learn 2 languages: French and Dutch. Afterwards I studied Business management in Dutch which I found extremely hard. I didn't finish my bachelor and left it for something more interesting. Yep! Again - making money. And I started working! Earning money is more joyful than studying especially studying something you are not even sure you want to work with. I'm working in the investments recovery service. What is a coincidence?! </p>

        <p>Our company returns your money that you lost because of misleading and fraud investments. I've been working here for a while already and found out that I'm loosing my sharp mind and needs some brain exercises! I started learning Spanish, my sixth language! Why not? Anyway my heart is still not satisfied as that job is kind of not for me. Money are not that important as your own satisfaction that your activity delivers some joy. I understood that I want to study, something new, all the time and without stress exams.</p>

        <p>While scrolling my facebook page and trying to find something I noticed one post. A 50 years old woman posted that she is interested in IT and need some suggestions. A lot of others women replied that this is a very interesting field and not only men are involved in such projects. Women are very welcome. There was one course organised in Uccle on Sundays in the middle of nowhere so I left that idea and scrolled down for more interesting content. After a while, probably almost a year, I found another post! A young woman posted that there is an organisation started a project which involve people interested in IT. Each Sunday and only 7 months. Hard working months! Free, no need to pay! And even laptopsare provided! And moreover women are welcome. So, in the city center, once a week, flexibility, short time - everything here is for me. Just lift your butt and start your new life. This is exactly what I need. 7 months is enough to understand and I don't have to quit my job!<br>
        <br>
        Well! Let's start!</p>
